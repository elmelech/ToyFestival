Pattern requested by ith person is a_i in pattern array a
3 carvers, can make x pattern in time 0, can make other pattern y in time |x-y|
Carvers can work on requests simultatiously (don't have to account for carver being busy)
Which pattern should each carver specialize in to minimize the max wait over all people

Input:
- # of testcases
- # of people coming
- pattern request array - length n

Output:
- The minimal max wait by any individual
'''

'''
Attempt 1:
- Brute force, try every permutation of carvers 1,2 and 3
- Track the max wait time for each
- Return carver 1, 2 and 3 locations that resulted in the minimum max wait time over all people

Attempt 2:

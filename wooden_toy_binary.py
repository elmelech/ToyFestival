'''
Attempt 2:
Binary Search version

''''
Logic:
- We want to divide the customer array into three segments that minimized the max range across all of them
- Find the borders of each section by estimating max wait time (t) directly
- We will be using binary search to narrow the window of possible wait times 
    - With a high wait time and a low wait time converging on the ideal wait time

Pseudocode:
- estimate wait time t as midpoint of wait time window
    - Calculate the right hand boarder of ranges of sections 
        - Section 1 (first element + 2t),
        - Section 2 (next element not covered by carver 1 + 2t), 
        - and Section 3 (next element not covered by carver 2 + 2t)
    - if final element of patterns array is within limits of section 3, the wait time estimate is either correct or too long
        - Move high down to midpoint
    - if final element of patterns array is not within limits of section 3, the estimated wait time is not long enough
        - move low up to midpoint+1
    - Recalculate the new midpoint of the window as the estimate t
    - repeat while lo < hi
    - return low
